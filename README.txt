This C++ project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition. This project was a small case study during a c++ course.
 3 files are contained:

	upc.cpp => contains procedural code for validating a UPC.

	CheckDigit-UPC.exe => used to run program.
	
	upc_sample.jpg => sample image of UPC code style needed for this program. (The program will work with any UPC as long as it is of the same format as the sample image)

Tips:

When running the program make sure your UPC matches the style in the example image. I have found some products around my house which match the UPC style and others that do not.
